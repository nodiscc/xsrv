# xsrv.wireguard

This role will install [Wireguard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WireGuard), a [virtual private network (VPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) server designed with the goals of ease of use, high speed performance, and low attack surface.

Clients of the wireguard server will be able to route their traffic through it.

```

See [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) for all configuration variables.

The server's UDP port `51820` must be reachable by clients. Configure NAT/port forwarding on your router if necessary, and allow port `51820/udp` in the host's firewall (if the [`ansible.xsrv.common`](../common) role is deployed, a `firewalld` rule is automatically added).


## Usage

### Connecting VPN clients

- Have all VPN clients generate their private/public keys:

> Please generate VPN keys by running:  
> `sudo apt install wireguard-tools`  
> `wg genkey | (umask 0077 && tee $HOSTNAME-wireguard.key) | wg pubkey > $HOSTNAME-wireguard.pub`  
> and send the contents of the `$HOSTNAME-wireguard.pub` file to the VPN server administrator. Keep a copy of the content of `$HOSTNAME-wireguard.key` somewhere safe as you will need it later. You may then delete `$HOSTNAME-wireguard.pub/key` files.

- Setup clients in `wireguard_peers` using the `public_key` value they provided and deploy the role.
- A configuration file for each client is generated in `data/wireguard/` in the playbook directory. Send their respective configuratino file to all clients - it contains further instructions to connect to the VPN on client machines.


### Debugging

You can turn on debug logging at any time by running `echo module wireguard +p | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control`. To disable debug logging: `echo module wireguard -p | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control`. Debug logging will log events such as peers connecting/disconnecting and rejected connection attempts.

### Backups

The server's private/public keys should be backed up. See the included [rsnapshot configuration](templates/etc/rsnapshot.d_wireguard.conf.j2) for information about directories to backup/restore.
