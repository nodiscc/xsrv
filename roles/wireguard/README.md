# xsrv.wireguard

This role will install [Wireguard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WireGuard), a [virtual private network (VPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) server designed with the goals of ease of use, high speed performance, and low attack surface.

Clients of the wireguard server will be able to route their traffic through it.

## Requirements/dependencies/example playbook

- See [meta/main.yml](meta/main.yml)
- The server's UDP port `51820` must be reachable by clients. Configure NAT/port forwarding on your router if necessary, and allow port `51820/udp` in the host's firewall (if the [`ansible.xsrv.common`](../common) role is deployed, a `firewalld` rule is automatically added).
- IP forwarding must be enabled on the host, for example using the [common](../common) role: `sysctl_allow_forwarding: yes`

## Usage

**Connecting VPN clients** VPN clients (peers) must generate their private/public keys beforehand:

> Please generate VPN keys by running:  
> `sudo apt install wireguard-tools`  
> `wg genkey | (umask 0077 && tee $HOSTNAME-wireguard.key) | wg pubkey > $HOSTNAME-wireguard.pub`  
> and send the contents of the `$HOSTNAME-wireguard.pub` file to the VPN server administrator. Keep a copy of the content of `$HOSTNAME-wireguard.key` somewhere safe as you will need it later. You may then delete `$HOSTNAME-wireguard.pub/key` files.

Setup clients in `wireguard_peers` using the `public_key` value they provided and deploy the role. A configuration file for each client will be generated in `data/wireguard/` in the playbook directory. Send their respective configuration file to all clients - it contains further instructions to connect to the VPN on client machines.

**List connected clients:** Access the server over SSH (`xsrv ssh`) and run `sudo wg`.

**Only allow VPN clients to connect to a service on the host:** When firewalld is managed by the [common](../common/) role, by default VPN clients are part of the `internal` zone. To make VPN clients part of the `wireguard` zone instead:

```yaml
# remove 10.0.0.0/8 from the internal zone
firewalld_zone_sources:
  - zone: internal
    sources:
      - 192.168.0.0/24
      - 10.0.1.0/24
      - 10.0.2.0/24
      - ...
  - zone: internal
    sources:
      - 10.0.0.0/8
    state: absent

# disallow connections from LAN to the service, but explicitly allow from wireguard
apache_firewalld_zones:
  - zone: public
    state: disabled
  - zone: internal
    state: disabled
  - zone: wireguard
    state: enabled

# to disallow connections from VPN clients instead, but still allow connections from LAN:
apache_firewalld_zones:
  - zone: public
    state: enabled
  - zone: internal
    state: enabled
  - zone: wireguard
    state: disabled
```

### Debugging

You can turn on debug logging at any time by running `echo module wireguard +p | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control`. To disable debug logging: `echo module wireguard -p | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control`. Debug logging will log events such as peers connecting/disconnecting and rejected connection attempts.

### Troubleshooting

**Unexpected failure during module execution: Incorrect padding:** make sure `public_key`s for `wireguard_peers` are valid 44 character long base64 keys generated by `wg genkey` or similar.

### Backups

The server's private/public keys should be backed up. See the included [rsnapshot configuration](templates/etc/rsnapshot.d_wireguard.conf.j2) for information about directories to backup/restore.
