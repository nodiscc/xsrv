# Server name and description
samba_netbios_name: "{{ ansible_hostname }}"
samba_server_string: "{{ ansible_hostname }} file server"
# List of samba shares. Each item has the following attributes:
#   name: (required): unique name for the share
#   allow_read_users (default none): list of users/groups allowed to read the share (use @groupname for groups)
#   allow_write_users (default none): list of users/groups allowed to write to the share (use @groupname for groups)
#   comment (default none): text  that is seen next to a share in share listings on clients
#   available: (yes/no, default yes): set to no to disable the share
#   browseable: (yes/no, default yes): set to no to hide the share from network share listings on clients (it can still be accessed)
#   state: (directory/absent, default 'directory') : set to 'absent' to delete the share. All data will be removed!
# Example:
# samba_shares:
#   - name: mycompany
#     comment: "File share for the whole company"
#     allow_read_users:
#       - alice

# samba_users:
#   - username: alice
#     password: "{{ samba_user_password_alice }}"
#   - username: bob
#     password: "{{ samba_user_password_bob }}"
