# xsrv.samba

This role will install [Samba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)), a file sharing service for various operating systems. Samba is a free software re-implementation of Microsoft SMB networking protocol.

The server is set up as a "standalone"/workgroup server (ie. not part of a domain) and uses standard Linux users as a backend for user accounts.
