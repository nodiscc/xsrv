#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
# are not shown in this example
#
# Some options that are often worth tuning have been included as
# commented-out examples in this file.
#  - When such options are commented with ";", the proposed setting
#    differs from the default Samba behaviour
#  - When commented with "#", the proposed setting is the default
#    behaviour of Samba but the option is considered important
#    enough to be mentioned here
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic 
# errors. 

#======================= Global Settings =======================

[global]

## Browsing/Identification ###

# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
{% if samba_passdb_backend == 'tdbsam' %}

   workgroup = {{ openldap_domain }}
{% endif %}

# What will appear in browse lists next to the machine name
# Default: server string = Samba %v
   server string = {{ samba_server_string }}

# This sets the NetBIOS name by which a Samba server is known.
# By default it is the same as the first component of the host's DNS name
   netbios name = {{ samba_netbios_name }}

# This will prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.
   dns proxy = no

#### Networking ####


# comma, space, or tab delimited set of hosts which are permitted to access a service.
# If specified in the [global] section then it will apply to all services,
# regardless of whether the individual service has a different setting.
  hosts allow = {{ ' '.join(samba_hosts_allow) }}

# The opposite of hosts allow - hosts listed here are NOT permitted access to
# services unless the specific services have their own lists to override this one.
# Where the lists conflict, the allow list takes precedence.
# In the event that it is necessary to deny all by default, use the keyword ALL
# (or the netmask 0.0.0.0/0) and then explicitly specify to the hosts allow
# parameter those hosts that should be permitted access.
  hosts deny = ALL

# The specific set of interfaces / networks to bind to
# This can be either the interface name or an IP address/netmask;
# interface names are normally preferred
;   interfaces = 127.0.0.0/8 eth0

# Only bind to the named interfaces and/or networks; you must use the
# 'interfaces' option above to use this.
# It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
# not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this
# option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.
;   bind interfaces only = yes

#### Debugging/Accounting ####

# This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
# that connects

# Cap the size of the individual log files (in KiB).
   max log size = {{ samba_max_log_size_kb }}

# Example: log level = 3 passdb:5 auth:10 winbind:2 
   log level = {{ samba_log_level }}

####### Authentication #######

# Server role. Defines in which mode Samba will operate. Possible
# values are "standalone server", "member server", "classic primary
# domain controller", "classic backup domain controller", "active
# directory domain controller".
