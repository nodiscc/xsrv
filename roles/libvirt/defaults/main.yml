# List of libvirt VMs to create/start/stop/shutdown/delete
# 'state: absent' deletes the VM BUT NOT THEIR DISKS/STORAGE VOLUMES (a.k.a. virsh undefine --delete-all-storage)
# 'state: destroyed' stops the VM without proper shutdown
# xml_file must point to a file containing a libvirt VM XML definition (https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html). You can use xsrv init-vm --dump option to display XML during VM creation.
# Example:
# libvirt_vms:
#  - name: vm01.CHANGEME.org # name of the VM/guest
#    state: present # present/running/destroyed/shutdown/absent, default present
#    autostart: yes # optional, default yes
