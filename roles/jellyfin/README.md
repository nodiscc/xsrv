## Usage

After initial installation, open https://media.CHANGEME.org in a web browser, and:
- set a Jellyfin administrator login/password
- add media libraries pointing to directories where your media files are stored:
  - Default media directory: `/var/lib/jellyfin/media/{movies,books,mixedcontent,shows,music,musicvideos,shows,photos}`
  - Jellyfin samba share (if the [samba](../samba) role is enabled): `/var/lib/jellyfin/sambashare/{movies,books,mixedcontent,shows,music,musicvideos,shows,photos}`
  - Transmission downloads directory (if the [transmission](../transmission) role is enabled): `/var/lib/transmission-daemon/downloads/{movies,books,mixedcontent,shows,music,musicvideos,shows,photos}`

### Uploading media

- Upload media files over [SFTP](../common#usage) to `~/MEDIA/` (symbolic link to `/var/lib/jellyfin/media/`)
- If the [samba](../samba) role is enabled and [`jellyfin_samba_share_enabled: yes` and a list of valid users](defaults/main.yml) are specified, upload files to the `smb://my.CHANGEME.org/jellyfin` samba share
- Download files from bittorrent using [transmission](../transmission)
- If the [nextcloud](../nextcloud) role is enabled, you may mount jellyfin's media directory as an [External Storage](../nextcloud/README.md#jellyfin)


### Playing media

Jellyfin lets you watch your media from a web browser on your computer, apps on your Roku, Android, iOS (including AirPlay), Android TV, or Fire TV device, or via your Chromecast or existing Kodi installation. See all [clients](https://jellyfin.org/clients/). [Finamp](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.unicornsonlsd.finamp/) is an alternative Android/iOS music player for Jellyfin.

You can also browse play Jellyfin media from any [DLNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance#Specification)-compatible media player on your local network, or use Jellyfin to play media thorugh any DLNA Media Renderer on your network. To use DLNA you must enable incoming/outgoing `UDP multicast on port 1900` traffic in the [firewall](../common). If you don't use DLNA it is recommended to turn it off completely under `Admin Dashboard > DLNA`.

### Backups

Automatic backups of the default media directory are disabled by default, unless [`jellyfin_enable_media_backups: yes`](defaults/main.yml). See the included [rsnapshot configuration](templates/etc/rsnapshot.d_jellyfin.conf.j2) for information about directories to backup/restore.

### LDAP authentication

To allow logins to Jellyfin using LDAP user accounts (for example from [openldap](../openldap)):
- Login to jellyfin using the initial/administrator account
- Open `Admin > Dashboard > Plugins > Catalog`
- Open `LDAP authentication` and click `Install`
- Restart the jellyfin server (from `Server > Dashboard > Restart` or `xsrv shell > sudo systemctl restart jellyfin`)
- Open `Admin > Dashboard > Plugins > LDAP-Auth` and configure the plugin:
  - LDAP server: `ldap.CHANGEME.org`
  - Secure LDAP: enabled (or disabled if your LDAP server does not support SSL/TLS)
  - Skip SSL verification: enable if your server is using a self-signed certificate
  - LDAP Base DN for searches: `dc=CHANGEME,dc=org`
  - LDAP port: `636` (SSL/TLS) or `389`
  - LDAP attributes: `uid, cn, mail`
  - LDAP Name Attribute: `uid`
  - LDAP User Filter: set to `(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)` if your LDAP server does not support the `memberOf` overlay (all LDAP users will be allowed to access Jellyfin). Otherwise set `memberOf=GROUPNAME` to the LDAP group name allowed to access Jellyfin (eg. `access_jellyfin`)
  - LDAP Admin Filter: users matching this filter will be given Jellyfin administrator privileges:
    - Set to `(enabledService=JellyfinAdministrator)` (default): if a LDAP user has the `jellyfinAdministrator` objectClass, it will automatically be set as Jellyfin administrator.
    - Set to `(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)` to give all users administrator rights by default. Administrators can still be managed manually from the web admin interface.
    - Use a `memberOf` filter looking for a specific group (eg. `(memberOf=cn=jellyfin_admins,ou=groups,dc=CHANGEME,dc=org)`) if your server supports `memberOf`, and add admin users to the LDAP group `jellyfin_admins`.
  - LDAP Bind User: `cn=bind,ou=system,dc=CHANGEME,dc=org`
  - LDAP Bind User Password: the value of `{{ openldap_bind_password }}`
  - [x] Enable User Creation
  - Click `Save`
- Restart the jellyfin server from the `Server > Dashboard` settings page

### Performance

When using Jellyfin from a web browser, media will be converted/transcoded on-the-fly to a format supported by the browser. You can also force transcoding to a lower quality directly from the `Settings > Quality` menu directly from the player. Transcoding will consume a noticeable amount of system (CPU/RAM) resources. On resource-constrained systems this may lead to playback issues or freezes and the server becoming unresponsive. To fix this several options exist:
- Disable `Allow playback of media that requires transcoding` for each user under `Admin > Dashboard > Users`. Currently there is [no global setting](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/645) to disable transcoding globally for all users.
- Use a [native client](https://jellyfin.org/clients/) which does not require server-side transcoding
- Manually setup [hardware acceleration](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration.html)

### Subtitles

To search and download video subtitles, register an account on https://opensubtitles.com, enable the `Opensubtitles` plugin from `Admin > Plugins` and set your opensubtitles.org username/password in the plugin preferences. Then obtain an API key by following the link the plugin settings. You will then be able to use right-click > `Edit subtitles` on any video from your library and search for matching subtitles.

### Metadata

The [Youtube Metadata Plugin](https://github.com/ankenyr/jellyfin-youtube-metadata-plugin) can be used to automatically set metadata for videos downloaded using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

### Chapter thumbnails on seek bar

Go `Administration > Dashboard > Libraries > Your Library` and `Enable chapter image extraction` to display thumbnails for each chapter while hovering the seek bar.

### Security

Due to [potential security issues](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/5415) in Jellyfin, it is not recommended to expose the service to untrusted networks. By default connections are allowed only from local network (RFC1918) addresses ([`jellyfin_allowed_hosts`](default/main.yml)).
