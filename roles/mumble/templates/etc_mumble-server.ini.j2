; Murmur configuration file.
;
; General notes:
; * Settings in this file are default settings and many of them can be overridden
;   with virtual server specific configuration via the Ice or DBus interface.
; * Due to the way this configuration file is read some rules have to be
;   followed when specifying variable values (as in variable = value):
;     * Make sure to quote the value when using commas in strings or passwords.
;        NOT variable = super,secret BUT variable = "super,secret"
;     * Make sure to escape special characters like '\' or '"' correctly
;        NOT variable = """ BUT variable = "\""
;        NOT regex = \w* BUT regex = \\w*

; Path to database. If blank, will search for
; murmur.sqlite in default locations or create it if not found.
database=/var/lib/mumble-server/mumble-server.sqlite

; Murmur defaults to using SQLite with its default rollback journal.
; In some situations, using SQLite's write-ahead log (WAL) can be
; advantageous.
; If you encounter slowdowns when moving between channels and similar
; operations, enabling the SQLite write-ahead log might help.
;
; To use SQLite's write-ahead log, set sqlite_wal to one of the following
; values:
;
; 0 - Use SQLite's default rollback journal.
; 1 - Use write-ahead log with synchronous=NORMAL.
;     If Murmur crashes, the database will be in a consistent state, but
;     the most recent changes might be lost if the operating system did
;     not write them to disk yet. This option can improve Murmur's
;     interactivity on busy servers, or servers with slow storage.
; 2 - Use write-ahead log with synchronous=FULL.
;     All database writes are synchronized to disk when they are made.
;     If Murmur crashes, the database will be include all completed writes.
;sqlite_wal=0

; If you wish to use something other than SQLite, you'll need to set the name
; of the database above, and also uncomment the below.
; Sticking with SQLite is strongly recommended, as it's the most well tested
; and by far the fastest solution.

; Murmur defaults to not using D-Bus. If you wish to use dbus, which is one of the
; RPC methods available in Murmur, please specify so here.
;
;dbus=system

; Alternate D-Bus service name. Only use if you are running distinct
; murmurd processes connected to the same D-Bus daemon.
;dbusservice=net.sourceforge.mumble.murmur

; If you want to use ZeroC Ice to communicate with Murmur, you need
; to specify the endpoint to use. Since there is no authentication
; with ICE, you should only use it if you trust all the users who have
; shell access to your machine.
; Please see the ICE documentation on how to specify endpoints.
#ice="tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6502"

; Ice primarily uses local sockets. This means anyone who has a
; user account on your machine can connect to the Ice services.
; You can set a plaintext "secret" on the Ice connection, and
; any script attempting to access must then have this secret
; (as context with name "secret").
; Access is split in read (look only) and write (modify)
; operations. Write access always includes read access,
; unless read is explicitly denied (see note below).
;
; Note that if this is uncommented and with empty content,
; access will be denied.

; If you want to expose Murmur's experimental gRPC API, you

; Note: not all builds of Murmur support gRPC. If gRPC is not
; available, Murmur will warn you in its log output.

; Per-user rate limiting
;
; These two settings allow to configure the per-user rate limiter for some
; command messages sent from the client to the server. The messageburst setting
; specifies an amount of messages which are allowed in short bursts. The
; messagelimit setting specifies the number of messages per second allowed over
; a longer period. If a user hits the rate limit, his packages are then ignored
; for some time. Both of these settings have a minimum of 1 as setting either to
; 0 could render the server unusable.
messageburst=5
messagelimit=1

; Respond to UDP ping packets.
;

; Mumble client, this information is shown in the Connect dialog.

; If you have a proper SSL certificate, you can provide the filenames here.
; Otherwise, Murmur will create its own certificate automatically.

; The sslDHParams option allows you to specify a PEM-encoded file with
; Diffie-Hellman parameters, which will be used as the default Diffie-
; Hellman parameters for all virtual servers.
;
; Instead of pointing sslDHParams to a file, you can also use the option
; to specify a named set of Diffie-Hellman parameters for Murmur to use.
; Murmur comes bundled with the Diffie-Hellman parameters from RFC 7919.
; These parameters are available by using the following names:
;
; @ffdhe2048, @ffdhe3072, @ffdhe4096, @ffdhe6144, @ffdhe8192
;
; By default, Murmur uses @ffdhe2048.
;sslDHParams=@ffdhe2048

; The sslCiphers option chooses the cipher suites to make available for use
; in SSL/TLS. This option is server-wide, and cannot be set on a
; per-virtual-server basis.
;
; This option is specified using OpenSSL cipher list notation (see
; https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html#CIPHER-LIST-FORMAT).
;
; It is recommended that you try your cipher string using 'openssl ciphers <string>'
; before setting it here, to get a feel for which cipher suites you will get.
;
; After setting this option, it is recommend that you inspect your Murmur log
; to ensure that Murmur is using the cipher suites that you expected it to.
;
; Note: Changing this option may impact the backwards compatibility of your
; Murmur server, and can remove the ability for older Mumble clients to be able
; to connect to it.

; This sets password hash storage to legacy mode (1.2.4 and before)
